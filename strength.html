                        <p><strong># Pilates : </strong>Pilates is a type of mind-body exercise in which each exercise flows from the "five essentials": breath, cervical alignment, rib and scapular stabilization, pelvic mobility, and utilization of the transversus abdominis. Each exercise is typically repeated three to five times.</p>
                        <p><strong># Benefits : </strong>Improved flexibility, increased muscle strength and tone, particularly of your abdominal muscles, lower back, hips and buttocks, balanced muscular strength on both sides of your body, enhanced muscular control of your back and limbs.</p>
                        <p><strong># How to do it : </strong> Along with proper breathing, some of the main tenets of Pilates are being able to center yourself (which helps with relaxation), concentrating your full attention on each motion and controlling every movement, and being aware of proper body alignment and striving to maintain it.</p>
                        <p><strong># How it's used : </strong>Pilates is a low-impact exercise that is gentle but challenging, and you can adapt a Pilates routine to your level.</p>
